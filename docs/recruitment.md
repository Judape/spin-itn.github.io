## Eligibility Criteria 

- Candidates can be of __any nationality__, and there is __no age limit__.
- At the time of recruitment, they must be in the __first four years of their research careers__ and __not yet__ have been awarded a __doctoral degree__. The four years start to count from the date when a researcher obtained the degree which would formally entitle him/her to embark on a doctorate.
- Candidates are required to __undertake transnational mobility__ (i.e., move from one country to another) when taking up their appointment. 
Candidates __must not have resided__ or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of the recruiting beneficiary __for more than 12 months in the 3 years__ immediately before the recruitment date. (Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays, and time spent as part of a procedure for obtaining refugee status are not taken into account.) 
- For all recruitment, the eligibility and mobility of the candidate will be __determined at the time of their recruitment in the project__.
- There are __no__ exceptions to these rules.
