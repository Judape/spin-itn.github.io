# Research
{:toc}

**Our research strategy** covers the entire workflow from instrument via
physics to monitoring applications: [**WP2**](/wp2/) develops and tests
new physical models of transient subsurface changes,
allowing conception of entirely new observation and
sensing strategies to be developed in [**WP1**](/wp1/). At the interface
between the scientific work packages is [**WP3**](/wp3/), providing
the methodological framework for optimal experiments for
specific research questions and applications. All these WPs
provide input to the hazard and monitoring applications to
be addressed in [**WP4**](/wp4/). The scientific WPs complement each
other, and are all embedded into the training WP.
Research output of SPIN flows into impact and
dissemination activities, and SPIN is supported overall by the
management WP.
